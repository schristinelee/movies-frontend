Moviebox. is a movie app similar to letterboxd. where users are able to search for the movie, leave reviews and add the movies to their favorites list or watched list. As a huge movie fan, I've always wanted to build an app related to movies and here is the very first app of mine!

I used Ruby on Rails for the backend and React.js for the frontend. I used TMDB, the movie database API to fetch some movie data such as trending movies, now playing movies, and top rated movies.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm run dev
```

You'll need to have the backend code (https://github.com/schristinelee/movies-backend) running on http://localhost:3000.
You can view the app on http://localhost:5173.

## Roadmap

List any ideas you plan on implementing in the future.
